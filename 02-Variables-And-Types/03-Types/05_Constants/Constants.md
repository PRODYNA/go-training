# Constants

Constants can be defined by a const block.
The values are typically inferred. You can use type conversion to create a distinct type

The most important difference to other languages like Java is that constants are CONSTANTS and cannot be changed.

The Naming convention is that Constants are named in CamelCase.

Constants are public and can be used anywhere by importing the package.


```golang

const (
    Pi = 3.1415
)
```
