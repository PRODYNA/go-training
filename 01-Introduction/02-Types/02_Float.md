# Floating Point

Go has floating points in 2 sizes: 32 bits and 64 bit.

Most math operations are defined only for float64 types.

## 32 Bit Floating Point


```golang

var x float32
x = 32.0
```

## 64 Bit Floating Point

```golang

var x float64
x = 64.0
```

# Pro Tips

## Complex Numbers


Go has support for complex numbers with the types.

* complex64
* complex128

## Complex 64
complex64  are 2 32 bit floats, combined to a complex number

## Complex 128
complex128  are 2 64 bit floats, combined to a complex number
